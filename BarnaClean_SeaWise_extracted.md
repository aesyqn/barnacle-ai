1.Biofouling growth
is unpredictable,
so vessels often
sail longer than
optimal before
cleaning.2. Reactive
maintenance drives
up docking time and
costs, and risks
unplanned delays.3. Excess drag from
fouling spikes fuel
use (by up to 30%),
increasing both
operating costs and
emissions.

1. BarnaClean’s AI model forecasts barnacle buildup in real time,
letting operators plan hull cleanings exactly when needed.
2. By integrating fouling forecasts into maintenance schedules, crews
can halve unplanned dry-dock visits and save on labor and materials.
3. Our AI-based routing engine factors in predicted drag, weather
and currents to cut fuel burn and CO₂ output on every voyage.

sea temperature and
salinity, which are key
drivers of barnacle growth
rates.
Voyage dynamics like real-
time marine weather (wind
speed/direction) and ocean
currents.

Preserving marine ecosystems requires more than technology, it needs active
community involvement. With greater awareness and real action, local communities,
fishermen, port workers, and coastal tourism operators can play a vital role in protecting
our oceans.

UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITIONBARNACLEAN is the first smart routing system to address a major blind
spot in maritime efficiency: barnacle biofouling.
Unlike traditional tools that focus only on weather and currents,
BARNACLEAN accounts for hull drag from marine growth, which can
silently raise fuel use by 30%.UNIQUE VALUE   
Predicting barnacle buildup based on water temperature, salinity, vessel
speed, and idle time.
Quantifying the fuel and emission impact of hull fouling in real-time.

NEXT  ST EPSAugust (Quarter-
Finals): Laying the
FoundationSeptember (Semi-
Finals): Building the
Engine
Acquire and process our
initial datasets (AIS, Marine
Weather, and Oceanographic
data).
Develop and validate V1 of
the Biofouling Prediction
Model to estimate growth
and drag.
Set up the basic FastAPI
server and core APIs.Integrate the biofouling
model into the A* routing
algorithm so it can weigh
hull drag alongside wind
and current data.
Develop the main user
interface and dashboard
structure in React.October (Pre-Finals):
Creating the Demo
Build the interactive map to
display the final, optimized
route and clearly show the
quantified fuel and CO₂
savings.
Refine the full application, fix
bugs, and prepare a
seamless demo experience.How we plan to build the prototype
